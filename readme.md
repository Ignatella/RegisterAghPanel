# RegisterAGHPanel xD

Reserve whatever you want, whenever it is comfortable for you.

## Usage

You can compile it for any platform you want and then:

```text
./RegisterAGHPanel -username ... -password ... -reservationPageId 2750 -date 2022-05-19 -time 08:00
```

Where

```text
-username -> your username
-password -> your password
-reservationPageId -> last argument of reservation page url. 
    Ex. https://panel.dsnet.agh.edu.pl/reserv/rezerwuj/2751. 
    So correct argument would be 2751.
-date -> date you want to reserve
-time -> time you want to reserve
```

### Never user it! :smile:
